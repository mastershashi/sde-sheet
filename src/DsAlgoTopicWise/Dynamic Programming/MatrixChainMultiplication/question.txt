Here are seven dynamic programming questions based on matrix chain multiplication:

Matrix Chain Multiplication

Given an array of matrices, find the minimum cost of multiplying these matrices together. The cost is determined by the number of scalar multiplications.
Optimal Parenthesization

Given a sequence of matrices, determine the optimal way to parenthesize them to minimize the total number of multiplications. Return the optimal parenthesization as well.
Maximum Chain Length

Given an array of matrices, find the maximum length of a chain that can be formed with the given matrices while maintaining compatibility in dimensions.
Count Different Parenthesizations

Given a sequence of matrices, count the number of distinct ways to parenthesize the matrices for multiplication, irrespective of the cost.
Matrix Chain Multiplication with Dimensions

Given a list of dimensions instead of matrices, compute the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply the matrices represented by those dimensions.
Longest Increasing Subsequence in Matrix Multiplication

Given a matrix chain, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence based on the dimensions of the matrices.
Balanced Matrix Chain Multiplication

Given a sequence of matrices, determine if it's possible to multiply them in such a way that results in a square matrix. If so, find the optimal multiplication strategy.
These questions cover various aspects of matrix chain multiplication and allow for exploration of dynamic programming techniques in this context
