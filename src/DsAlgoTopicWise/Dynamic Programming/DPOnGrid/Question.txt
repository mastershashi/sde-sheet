Hereâ€™s a list of 14 dynamic programming questions based on grid problems:

Unique Paths

Given a m x n grid, find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, moving only down or right.
Minimum Path Sum

Given a grid of non-negative integers, find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right that minimizes the sum of the numbers along the path.
Maximal Square

Given a 2D binary grid, find the largest square containing only 1s and return its area.
Word Search II

Given a board of characters and a list of words, find all words in the board using dynamic programming to optimize the search.
Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

Given a matrix of integers, find the length of the longest increasing path.
Unique Paths II

Similar to the Unique Paths problem, but with obstacles represented by 1s. Return the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner.
Count Squares

Given a 2D matrix filled with 0s and 1s, count the number of square submatrices with all 1s.
Minimum Falling Path Sum

Given a square array of integers, find the minimum sum of a falling path from the top to the bottom.
Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0s and 1s, find the largest rectangle containing only 1s and return its area.
Path with Minimum Effort

Given a 2D array of heights, find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right that minimizes the maximum height difference along the path.
Cherry Pickup

In a grid, you and your friend start at the top-left corner and want to collect as many cherries as possible by moving to the bottom-right corner. Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect.
Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence using a grid to store intermediate results.
Edit Distance

Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other using a grid to keep track of edit distances.
Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position

Given the positions of chips on a line, find the minimum cost to move all chips to the same position, treating it like a grid where movement cost is defined.
These problems cover a wide range of applications for dynamic programming on grids and can help strengthen your understanding of the topic.
