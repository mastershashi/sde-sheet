Here are ten dynamic programming questions based on the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) concept:

Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
Longest Bitonic Subsequence

Find the length of the longest subsequence that first increases and then decreases in a given array.
Longest Increasing Subsequence with One Deletion

Given an array, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence that can be achieved by deleting at most one element.
Number of Longest Increasing Subsequences

Given an array, count the number of distinct longest increasing subsequences.
Longest Increasing Subsequence in a 2D Matrix

Given a 2D matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.
Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence

Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence.
Longest Increasing Subsequence with Constraints

Given an array of integers where each element has an associated constraint, find the longest increasing subsequence that satisfies these constraints.
Longest Increasing Subsequence in a String

Given a string, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence based on the ASCII values of the characters.
Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string, find the length of the longest subsequence that is a palindrome, leveraging the LIS concept.
Longest Subsequence with Difference of 1

Given an array, find the length of the longest subsequence where the difference between consecutive elements is 1.
