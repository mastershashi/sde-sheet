Here are five dynamic programming questions based on trees:

Maximum Path Sum

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.
Diameter of a Binary Tree

Find the diameter of a binary tree, which is the length of the longest path between any two nodes. The diameter may or may not pass through the root.
Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Calculate the maximum depth (or height) of a binary tree using dynamic programming principles by storing the depths of subtrees.
Balanced Binary Tree

Determine if a binary tree is height-balanced, meaning the left and right subtrees of any node differ in height by no more than one. Use dynamic programming to store the height of subtrees.
Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

Given a binary tree and two nodes, find their lowest common ancestor using a dynamic programming approach to cache the parent nodes or subtree information.
