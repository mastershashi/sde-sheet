Here are six dynamic programming questions based on Kadane's Algorithm:

Maximum Subarray Sum

Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum and return that sum.
Maximum Product Subarray

Find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest product. Return the maximum product.
Maximum Sum Circular Subarray

Given a circular array, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. This may involve wrapping around to the start of the array.
Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements

Given an array, find the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements. This problem can be solved using a variation of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm.
Maximum Subarray Length with Given Sum

Given an array and a target sum, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray that sums to the target sum.
Find All Subarrays with Maximum Sum

Given an integer array, return all contiguous subarrays that have the maximum sum, not just the sum itself.
