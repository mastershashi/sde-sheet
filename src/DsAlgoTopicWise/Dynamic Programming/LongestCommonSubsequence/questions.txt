Here are 15 dynamic programming questions based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) concept:

Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence.
Print Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings, not only find the length of the longest common subsequence but also print the subsequence itself.
Longest Repeating Subsequence

Given a string, find the length of the longest subsequence that can be formed by repeating some of its characters.
Minimum Deletions to Make Strings Equal

Given two strings, find the minimum number of deletions required to make them equal using the concept of LCS.
Minimum Insertions to Make String Palindrome

Given a string, find the minimum number of insertions needed to make it a palindrome using LCS.
Longest Common Substring

Find the length of the longest substring that appears in both given strings.
Longest Common Subsequence with K Distinct Characters

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence that contains at most K distinct characters.
Wild Card Matching

Implement wildcard matching using LCS, where ? matches any single character and * matches any sequence of characters.
Count Distinct Subsequences

Given two strings, count the number of distinct subsequences of one string that equal the other string.
Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence using LCS.
Edit Distance

Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another using LCS to derive the edit distance.
Longest Common Subsequence with Cost

Given two strings with associated costs for each character, find the longest common subsequence while minimizing the total cost.
Maximum Product of Lengths of LCS

Given two arrays, find the maximum product of lengths of two LCS that can be formed with different pairs of arrays.
Longest Common Subsequence of Multiple Strings

Given three or more strings, find the longest common subsequence among them.
Subsequence of a Subsequence

Given two strings, find the length of the longest common subsequence where the characters must appear in the same order as they appear in both strings.
These questions cover a variety of applications and extensions of the Longest Common Subsequence problem, helping to deepen your understanding of dynamic programming techniques.
