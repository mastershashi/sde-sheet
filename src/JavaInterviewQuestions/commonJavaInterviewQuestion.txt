What is Serialisation and Deserialisation?

Answer: yes provided that non-serialisable super class has no args constructor which is involved at deserialisation to initialise the super class.

What is Synchronisation?Types of Synchronisation?
Object Level Locking vs Class Level Locking?
If there is 2 synchronised methods m1 and m2 in a class, can 2 different threads t1 and t2 call different methods(m1,m2) respectively on same object of class c at same time ?
Answer — No. Only 1 Thread can hold the lock on a object of a class.However the other non synchronised methods can be called on same object.
If a class has a synchronised method and non synchronised method, can multiple threads execute non synchronised methods?
Answer: yes. If a class has a synchronised method and non synchronised method , multiple threads can access non synchronised methods.
Can 2 threads call 2 different static synchronised methods of same class?
Answer : The static synchronised methods of same class always block each other as 1 lock per class exists. So no 2 static synchronised methods can execute at the same time.
Does static synchronised methods block a non synchronised methods?
Answer: No. The thread executing static synchronised method holds a lock on the class and the executing the non static synchronised method holds lock on the object on which the method has been called, these 2 locks are different and these threads dont block eachother.
Can Constructors be synchronised?

Important multithreading questions:

1.  * Write a program to implement bounded blocking queue. This is similar to consumer producer problem
 * Properties of queue
 * 1) If queue is empty poll will wait with timeout till item is available
 * 2) If queue is full offer will wait with timeout till space is available

2.  * 
 * Write a program to count words. This program should be threadsafe.
 * Implement two apis 
 * 1) void addWord(String word) -> increment count of this word
 * 2) long getCount(String word) -> get count of this word
 * 
 * Solution
 * Keep a concurrent map. Key to this map should be word while value should be AtomicLong to update it
 * in threadsafe way
 * 
 * Test cases
 * One word updated by many threads
 * Many words updated by many threads
 *
 *@Threadsafe
 */

3.  * Write a program which fills up boolean matrix from top left to bottom right with true. 
 * This program should support two apis
 * 1) void updateMatrix() which updates last position of matrix with true
 * 2) boolean getVal(int x,int y) return boolean val at matrix[x][y]
 * 
 * This program should be threadsafe.
 * 
 * Solution
 * Use AtomicLong to increment the value and return old value.
 * 
 * Test cases
 * 1) Try with single thread
 * 2) Try with multiple threads and big matrix size.
 *
 4. * 
 * Write a program which keeps min and max value in threadsafe way
 * Support 2 apis
 * void updateMaxMin(int val)
 * int getMin()
 * int getMax()
 * 
 * Solution
 * Use compareAndSet method of AtomicInteger to update min and max
 *
 * @ThreadSafe
 5. /**
 * A class that has 5 threads - two to increment the myVar variable, two to decrement the myVar variable and one to print the value of myVar.
 * Implement increment(), decrement() and printVar() methods such that the following series is printed:
 * 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 ... (repeating)
 */

 6.  *
 * Develop a software to count number of events in last 5 mins. You have to support two apis
 * 1) addEvent() -> It means increment event by 1
 * 2) getTotalEvents() -> Return total number of events in last 5 mins
 * 
 * Program should support millions of events every minute and should also provide multi-threading support
 * 
 * This class might not have 100% accuracy as far as events in last 5 mins are concerned. 
 * Since we are using circular queue last second information may not be very accurate.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * Keep atomiclong of 300 in array. PositionUpdater updates position every second.
 * @Threadsafe

 7. /**
 * Given a queue which gets millions of messages. Message is of form <Domain,Update>.
 * You have 10000 domain tables. Also you have 50 worker threads. You can only get 
 * data from front of the queue. Threads get data from the front and then update the 
 * domain table. If work is being done on domain table you cannot apply another update.
 * Update should also be applied sequentially. So an update coming later on should not
 * be applied before an update coming sooner.
 */
 8. /**
 * Design a mutex using 2 variable method assuming operation ice happens atomically
 */
 9. Create a thread pool
 10. /**
 * Facebook interview question
 * Implement a non block run which takes as many runnables as given but only
 * runs a specified number of threads.
 * You can also update maxSize in between which will change number of threads executing
 * http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/thread-pools.html
